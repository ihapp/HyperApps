# Internet Hyper Application

## What is HyperApp?

A HyperApp is a Web application bundle that contains everything it needs to run locally inside a virtual machine instead of on a remote server:

HyperApps are built as regular Web applications with Node.js, AJAX, PHP, ASP.NET, servlets, etc.

## Why HyperApps?

A HyperApp can serve static and dynamic content locally while communicating with a remote web server if needed. Thus, HyperApps can dramatically improve performance, the user experience and leverage underlying hardware capabilities without compromising security in comparison with desktop/native applications. Note, HyperApps preserve the same-origin policy and can only connect to their origin web servers. 

Since HyperApps work as a proxy web server they allow to delegate more processing to the local virtual machine and build more declarative GUI.

In essence, HyperApps are lightweight client-side servers that unify desktop/native and web applications. They are built on top of virtualization, thus isolated from each other and the host, and provide more security to end users and businesses.

HyperApp states can be easily backed up to a cloud allowing HyperApps sharing between computers: office, home, laptop, tablet, etc. as well as restoring them in case of hardware failure.

HyperApps are easy to clone, deploy, and test thus reducing the cycle time of development.
